## 🕯️ About the Game
**Reflections** is a browser-based survival horror experiment that breaks the fourth wall. Unlike traditional games, this experience uses computer vision to monitor the player's physical reactions.

The game environment reacts to **YOU**:
* **Facial Recognition:** The game tracks your mouth and face. If you scream or drop your jaw in terror, the entities in the game become more aggressive.
* **Hand Tracking:** Certain doors and puzzles are "biometrically locked." You must physically raise your hand to align virtual signals in 3D space.
* **Sanity System:** The more you panic in real life (erratic movement), the more the game world distorts.

## 🕹️ Controls
* **W, A, S, D**: Move
* **Mouse**: Look
* **E**: Interact (Read notes, pick up batteries, open doors)
* **F**: Toggle Flashlight
* **Click**: Lock Cursor / Resume Game

## 🛠️ Technology
This project was built using vanilla JavaScript and modern web technologies:
* **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/):** For the 3D environment, lighting, and physics.
* **[MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe):** For real-time FaceMesh and Hand tracking directly in the browser.
* **Web Audio API:** For procedural, spatial audio and atmosphere.
